# Project chess
Made in a week by myself.
<br/>
This project was the end project for the subject "Basic Programmering".
<br/>
The assignment was: In a group of three; each person have to make a game into a C# console app. You can choose between classics such as MasterMind, MineSweeper, Chess, Battleship and Jeopardy. Your game has to be as close to the original game as possible. 

<br/>

Your solution should preferably only use the elements you have learned in the thery week:
 - Use flow control and loops
 - Can use boolean conditions
 - Capable to organize the code in a logic and clear way
 - Can remedy the system of possible errors and missing
 - Can use correct notations e.g. Microsoft code-standard such as Pascal- and Camel casing
 - Understanding and application of correct data types and data sets (arrays)
 - Understanding variables and scopes
 - Can document the code


### What you will get an evaluation of is:
 - The source code
 - The expression of the game
